## About the Author

I'm a graphic designer (7-8 years professional experience) — **not a traditional engineer**. This project is what becomes possible when a designer with strong product thinking pairs with AI development tools (Claude Code) and gives themselves time to research deeply.

I'm not claiming I write production-grade code from scratch. I'm claiming: I researched a real social problem, made the product decisions, drove the build via AI pair-programming, audited my own security, and knew when to stop. That's the skill set this project demonstrates.

## TL;DR

I researched the working conditions of Taiwan's ~220,000 foreign live-in caregivers, identified 5 systemic challenges (phone access, fatigue, scope ambiguity, community gaps, power asymmetry), then drove the build of a dual-end product using Claude Code:

- **Caregiver PWA**: A daily activity logger and family communication tool — 3-second logging (vitals, medication, falls, meals, sleep, stool) with caregiver notes, multi-elder medical info cards, full offline-capable PWA.
- **Family-side LINE Bot**: 6-digit pairing, signed webhook, push notification when caregiver explicitly shares a record.

Then I ran a structured security audit against OWASP + Taiwan's PDPA (個資法), produced a 15-finding report, and shipped fixes for all 11 critical/high-severity issues.

**Scope decision**: An earlier version included a 50-scenario medical triage library with named-source citations. I removed it after threat-modeling the legal exposure: a graphic designer (me) shipping medical advice via AI tools, even with disclaimers, sits in a risk profile where one negative outcome → 50-300K NTD lawsuit + permanent name-search hit. The communication/logging layer is genuinely useful without that exposure. **Knowing what NOT to ship is part of the skill set.** The medical content research lives in git history and the user's research memos, available for an NGO partner who can carry the legal weight properly.

Currently in active conversation with Taiwan Alzheimer's Disease Association about partnership — TADA's role would be promoting the tool to their family-caregiver network and integrating their existing services (失智關懷專線 0800-474-580, 愛的手鍊), not endorsing medical content I authored.

## Why This Exists

### The problem space

Taiwan has **~220,000 foreign live-in caregivers**, mostly from Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, working under labor contracts that strip many normal worker protections. They are typically:

- The **only person** in the household who notices subtle medical changes in a frail elder
- Working **24/7 on-call** with limited rest
- **Fluent in Mandarin only enough to survive** — medical terms, dialect, regional pronunciations are gaps
- **Not the decision-maker** when something goes wrong — the family is, and they're often remote
- Already using **smartphones and Facebook/Zalo** as their lifeline to home

### What I researched first

I spent a chunk of time reading rather than coding:

- Taipei Government's trilingual caregiver handbook (zh-TW + EN, ID, VI; 2022)
- Kaohsiung Chang Gung × KCG's dementia care Q&A (130p, trilingual)
- Taipei "Memory Watch" dementia handbook (88p)
- Reports from MENT (Taiwan Migrant Caregivers Association), TIWA, the labor bureau

I broke the findings into 5 challenges (each got its own deep-dive memo before any code was written):

| # | Challenge | Key insight |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Phone access constraints | Caregiver phones are often confiscated/restricted by the employer. The app has to work in **15-second snatched glances**, no notifications, no chrome. |
| 2 | Chronic fatigue | Information density kills usage. Inverted-pyramid triage (what to do *now*) beats reference-style content. |
| 3 | Scope creep / contract ambiguity | Caregivers are routinely asked to do tasks outside their contract. The app should **inform** without taking sides on labor disputes. |
| 4 | Community trust gaps | Caregivers verify info with their FB/Zalo communities, not authorities. App can't replace community — it should produce **shareable cards** that survive the FB share flow. |
| 5 | Power asymmetry | Workers can't dispute employers without risk. Tools that store data in the family's account replicate the asymmetry. **Data co-ownership** is a feature, not a nice-to-have. |

These shaped every product decision below.

## What's in the App

### Caregiver side (PWA)

- **3-second logging**: 6 record types (temp, stool, sleep, fall, med, meal) with **5-tap quick phrases + free-text caregiver notes**
- **Multi-elder medical info cards** (medications, allergies, contacts, doctor) — informational data the caregiver enters, not medical advice
- **Today summary** widget — shows daily count + how many shared with family
- **Emergency hotlines** quick page — 119 / 110 / 1955 (foreign worker rights) / 0800-474-580 (dementia care) / 113 (protection)
- **Full offline support** via Service Worker (cache-first for assets, network-first for nav)
- **Encrypted backup files** (PBKDF2 + AES-GCM 256) for safe backup-file sharing
- **PWA installable**, dark mode, Lucide React icons, custom design tokens
- **No analytics, no trackers, no third-party JS**

### Family side (LINE Bot)

- LINE Messaging API channel; webhook with **HMAC-SHA256 signature verification**
- 6-digit pairing codes (32-char alphabet, confusables removed) with **24-hour TTL**
- **Anti-hijack guard**: bind only succeeds if `paired_line_user_id IS NULL` (Postgres-level check)
- **Rate limited** at 5 attempts per LINE userId per 5 minutes (in-memory)
- Push notification triggered by caregiver pressing "送出給家屬" toggle (default OFF)

### Security & privacy

- HTTPS-only, security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Permissions-Policy)
- Same-origin guard on POST endpoints (CSRF defense beyond SameSite cookies)
- Sanitized error messages (no DB schema leakage)
- Encrypted backup file format (PBKDF2-SHA256 200k iterations + AES-GCM 256-bit)
- Audit log table with **IP anonymization** (last octet zeroed, IPv6 truncated)
- **Right-to-erasure** API + UI button (PDPA Article 11 compliance)
- LINE userId never exposed to client JS (no XSS exfil path)
- **Scroll-gated dual consent flow** — first-time users must expand both Privacy and Terms accordions and scroll each to the bottom before the "I agree" button enables. Versioned in localStorage so policy bumps re-prompt.

Full audit report: [SECURITY_AUDIT.md](./SECURITY_AUDIT.md). 15 findings, 11 fixed, 4 deliberately deferred with documented threat-model reasoning.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (Turbopack) + React 19 | App router for clean route splitting; React Server Actions for the OAuth login flow (Auth.js v5 requires this) |
| Auth | Auth.js v5 (next-auth@beta) + LINE provider | The only login most caregivers already have |
| Database | Supabase (Postgres + REST) | Free tier covers prototyping; SQL is honest about schema |
| Push | LINE Messaging API | Lower friction than push notifications which iOS PWAs barely support |
| Styling | Tailwind 4 + Lucide React | No design system framework needed at this scale |
| Hosting | Vercel | Zero-config Next.js deploys |
| PWA | Hand-written Service Worker | No third-party PWA plugin — clear control of cache strategy |

### What I deliberately didn't use

- **No state management library** — `useState` + `localStorage` are enough; the app is mostly forms and lists
- **No analytics** — privacy first; if I need usage data later, I'll instrument explicitly
- **No CSS-in-JS runtime** — Tailwind compiles down, no runtime cost
- **No Supabase Auth** — LINE Login was already required; layering Supabase Auth on top would mean managing two identity systems

---

## Key Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. LINE Bot vs. Web Push

Web Push on iOS PWAs is unreliable until users install the home-screen icon, and even then is brittle. Most Taiwanese families already use LINE 24/7. Choosing LINE shifted the privacy boundary (LINE Corp sees the messages) but bought a **higher delivery rate** and **zero install friction** for family.

I documented the trade-off in the privacy policy explicitly.

### 2. Service-role + auth-check vs. Supabase RLS

I chose service-role with strict server-side auth checks over RLS. RLS is architecturally cleaner but would require switching the app to use anon-key + custom JWT minting — a multi-day refactor for marginal real-world security gain since service-role is already server-only.

I marked it as a Phase B TODO for production, with the threat-model reasoning written in the audit.

### 3. localStorage encryption: deliberately not done

I considered encrypting `localStorage` PII at rest with WebCrypto. After threat-modeling: any attacker with device access who can read `localStorage` can also read `IndexedDB` where the key would live. It's **theater**, not real protection.

I implemented **encrypted backup files** instead (PBKDF2 + AES-GCM with user passphrase) — that protects the most realistic threat: backup JSON files accidentally shared via Email/Drive.

### 4. Pivot away from medical content

The original v1 included 50 scenarios with red/orange/green triage and treatment steps, citing named Taiwan healthcare sources. After scoping the legal risk — even with disclaimers, AI-drafted medical content shipped by a non-medical author creates direct liability — I removed it.

The pivot reframed the product from "medical reference + log" to "log + family communication tool". The remaining surface (logging, medical-info cards, family push) involves zero medical advice — it's just data the caregiver enters and a controlled channel to share it. This is a fundamentally different risk profile.

The research and content drafts still exist in git history and personal research memos, available for any NGO partner who can carry the legal weight properly.

### 5. Stop at portfolio, not commercial

This was the hardest call. The app works. I could push for government procurement (the Taipei Bureau of Labor has budget for migrant worker tools).

But the compliance lift to go from "works for friends" to "publicly listed gov-procured service" is realistically:

- 个資保護管理制度 (PIMS) — 30-100K TWD / year consulting
- ISO 27001 — 50-150K one-time
- Penetration test — 12-30K / year
- Privacy/ToS lawyer review — 30-50K
- 24/7 on-call ops

…and I have a full-time job and a music side career. So I'm:

1. **Keeping it as portfolio + open source**
2. **Reaching out to dementia/Red Cross associations** that have the institutional capacity
3. **Stripping it down to portfolio-safe scope** (no public sign-up, banner labeling it as prototype)

This decision is itself a portfolio signal: knowing what NOT to build is more valuable than building everything.

## What This Project Demonstrates (Designer-as-Builder Skill Set)

This is intentionally a portfolio piece for a *designer* role, not a dev role. The skills it shows:

| Skill | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Research before designing** | 5 challenge memos, 6+ source documents, before the first wireframe |
| **Product decision-making** | The 4 trade-off analyses (LINE vs Push, RLS vs service-role, encrypt vs not, stop vs commercialize) |
| **AI-assisted execution** | Drove a full Next.js + Auth + DB + LINE Bot build via Claude Code as a non-traditional coder |
| **Self-auditing rigor** | Ran a structured 15-finding security audit and shipped 11 fixes — most designers (and many engineers) wouldn't |
| **Knowing the boundary** | Identified the commercial-vs-portfolio fork point and made a defensible call |
| **Stakeholder communication** | NGO outreach letter, privacy policy in plain Chinese, threat-model write-ups |

If you're hiring a senior designer / product designer / design lead, this is what I bring beyond Figma.

## What I'd Do Differently

If I were starting over, knowing what I know now:

1. **Talk to caregivers first, code second.** I read research instead. Research is great for context but worse than 3 user interviews for prioritization. (Stalled by the contact problem in Challenge 5 — workers can't easily talk to outsiders without employer interference.)

2. **Lock the data shape before building scenario content.** I had to migrate the storage format twice when adding multi-elder support and caregiver notes — and then I scoped out the scenario library entirely. The early data-shape lockdown would have helped either way.

3. **Decide on the LINE-vs-Push architecture before the PWA shell.** I built a Web Push prototype that I later threw away.

4. **Write the privacy policy first.** Doing it last forced retroactive changes (the audit found `lineUserId` exposed via `/api/session`, which existed because I'd designed it without thinking about XSS surface).

5. **Scope the legal risk *before* building content.** I built 50 medical scenarios with full triage logic, then realized the liability profile was too high for a non-medical author shipping via AI tools. Removed the entire content library mid-project. Better to scope risk on day 1.
